Code for comparing a normalizing flow to extreme-deconvolution
in reconstructing a color-magnitude diagram
from noisy observations.

The normalizing flow code is from here: https://github.com/rtqichen/ffjord


The paper demonstrating this on real data is here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08045

(This one uses MADE)
